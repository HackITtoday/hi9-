    <h2>Your Administration Pages</h2>
    <p>The most important thing to remember about all these tools is that you, as an administrator can create, change or update all or any of them at any given time. Smart eh?</p>
    <p>Each tool has been created to improve your understanding and knowledge about your end users, whether it’s as individuals or as a collective body</p>
    <p>Some of the information extrapolated, like mobile data usage, will be broken down by name while other, like visits to various white listed sites (as determined by yourself) will be displayed anonymously</p>
    <p>We will be emailing you regularly with updates and additions to your tools! In the meanwhile, below is a brief outline of what’s currently available</p>
    <a href="/admin/badges"><paper-button raised>Badges</paper-button></a>
    <p>Badges are multi-functional. First and foremost from an administrative point of view they provide an insight into skill levels and achievements. 
    <br />Badges are awarded on the completion of a task which can be anything from sending an email, answering a set of survey questions, to enrolling and completing a course on an education platform like Khan Academy
    <br />The badges act as an incentive to the user to nudge them forwards to expand their skills.  How and what they are awarded for is entirely up to you. Rewards might be something like extra data usage. The choice is yours</p>
    <a href="/admin/surveys"><paper-button raised>Surveys</paper-button></a>
    <p>Surveys are another way to assess how users are doing, what’s working ie what’s being used and what’s not, plus where if any, are the sticking points
    <br />Over a short period of time an administrator will have a good overview of user behaviour.
    <br />This insight allows administrators to pivot accordingly.
    <br />Again, like with badges, the choice of questions or changes/additions to questions is entirely with you</p>
    <a href="/admin/help"><paper-button raised>Help</paper-button></a>
    <p>Our help section is based around frequently asked questions and is obviously continually evolving. Additions and changes can be made by the administrator at any time</p>
    <a href="/admin/cards"><paper-button raised>Cards</paper-button></a>
    <p>Cards are what’s seen by the user on the front end of the site. Cards can be added, changed or deleted by an administrator t any time to create a bespoke package that’s best suited to its user's particular needs</p>
    <a href="/admin/users"><paper-button raised>Users</paper-button></a>
    <p>The User section provides admin. with insight into individual profiles. It shows an array of information ranging from mobile data usage to answers from survey questions, badges earned to questions asked via the Help section</p>
