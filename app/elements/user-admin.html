    <h2>Your Administration Pages</h2>
    <p>The most important thing to remember about all these tools is that you, as an administrator can create, change or update all or any of them at any given time. Smart eh?</p>
    <p>Each tool has been created to improve your understanding and knowledge about your end users, whether it’s as individuals or as a collective body</p>
    <p>Some of the information extrapolated, like mobile data usage, will be broken down by name while other, like visits to various white listed sites (as determined by yourself) will be displayed anonymously</p>
    <p>We will be emailing you regularly with updates and additions to your tools! In the meanwhile, below is a brief outline of what’s currently available</p>
